# Rainbow Role Discord
The following code makes the "Rainbow" Role
Where the color of the a user's role keeps changing

All you need to do is:
  + getting the token of a discord bot
  + then put the token inside the file called [.env](https://github.com/JagTheFriend/Rainbow-Role-Discord/blob/main/.env)
  + then run the file called [main.py](https://github.com/JagTheFriend/Rainbow-Role-Discord/blob/main/main.py)
  + if you get import errors, then make sure that you have installed discord.py via pip [pip install discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)

Once the bot is up and running, add it to a server with atleast 2 or more people in it <br>
(make sure you have given the bot admin perms) <br>

All you have to do is go to a chat, then <br>
use this command `%rb @Person` to give the Person the Special role <br>
(Note: `%` is prefix of the bot, so if you have changed it, then you will have to use the new prefix)

Note: For now, you will have to manually remove the Special role from the user


# Please note that: IT MIGHT GIVE YOU EPILEPTIC SEIZURES
